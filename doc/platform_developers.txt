=======================
For platform developers
=======================

This page describes how to install, configure and use the Python script which takes jobs from the queue server,
submits them to SLURM, and then posts the results back to the queue server on job completion.


Installation
============

Clone the Git repository::

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/apdavison/nmpi.git

This is a private repository which only allows a limited number of users. I suggest having one user for Heidelberg and
one for Manchester (send your Bitbucket username to Andrew Davison). If this is insufficient, we can move the Git
repository elsewhere.

Install the requirements and the Python package. We strongly recommend using virtualenv or Anaconda.

::

    $ cd nmpi/nmpi_client
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install

This installs the `nmpi` Python package and puts an executable script, :file:`nmpi_saga.py` in the :file:`bin`
directory of your virtualenv.


Configuration
=============



Running the SAGA script
=======================

You will probably wish to run the script, :file:`nmpi_saga.py`, manually during testing, but it is intended to be
launched periodically using cron in production.


Configuring cron
